{- 1.1.0 Concatenation of lists.

   The standard library infix operator ++ concatenates (appends) two
   lists. Use it to write a function in pattern matching style which
   concatenates a list of lists. We have given you an unfinished
   definition which you should refine into suitable cases and
   complete. -}

concatLists :: [[x]] -> [x]
concatLists []       = []
concatLists (xs:xss) = xs ++ concatLists xss

{- It may help to think concretely:

   (a) What should
           concatLists [[1], [2,3], [4,5,6]]
       be?

   (b) What should
           concatLists [[2,3], [4,5,6]]
       be?

   (c) How do you combine the list '[1]' with the answer to (b) to
   make the answer to (a)? Remember that '[[1], [2,3], [4,5,6]]' is
   syntactic sugar for '[1]:[2,3]:[4,5,6]:[]'. -}

{- 2 MARKS -}


{- 1.1.1 Cons-ing an element to every list in a list of lists.

   The cons constructor ':' takes an element 'x' and a list 'xs', and
   creates a new list 'x:xs' with 'x' at the head and 'xs' at the
   tail. (See the Week 01 videos and notes.)

   Write a function that performs the cons operation to every list in
   a list of lists. For example:

        consAll 1 [[2,3],[4,5]] == [[1,2,3],[1,4,5]]
        consAll 1 [[]]          == [[1]]
        consAll 1 []            == []
-}

consAll :: a -> [[a]] -> [[a]]
consAll x []       = []
consAll x (xs:xss) = (x:xs):consAll x xss

{- 2 MARKS -}


{- 1.1.2 Splitting Lists.

   The function 'splitOn' splits a list at every occurence of some
   value. Examples:

      splitOn 0 [1,2,0,3,0]   == [[1,2],[3],[]]
      splitOn 0 [1,2,0,3,0,4] == [[1,2],[3],[4]]
      splitOn 0 []            == [[]]
      splitOn 0 [0]           == [[],[]]
      splitOn 0 [0,0]         == [[],[],[]]

   Because strings are lists of 'Char's, 'splitOn' is a useful way of
   breaking down strings:

       splitOn ':' "Ty Per:ty.per@example.com" == ["Ty Per", "ty.per@example.com"]

   Write the function 'splitOnHelper' that 'splitOn' uses to work. -}

splitOn :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [[a]]
splitOn splitChar xs = splitOnHelper splitChar [] xs

splitOnHelper :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [a] -> [[a]]
splitOnHelper s group [] = [reverse group]
splitOnHelper s group (x:xs)
  | x == s    = reverse group : splitOnHelper s [] xs
  | otherwise = splitOnHelper s (x:group) xs

{- HINT: 'splitOnHelper' works by gathering elements of the input list
   'xs' in 'groups' until it sees an occurence of the splitting
   value. When it sees a splitting value, it returns a new list
   element containing the current group (reversed back to normal), and
   then carries on with a new empty group. When it runs out of
   elements to process, the current group is reversed and becomes the
   last element of the output list.

   You can use the standard library function 'reverse' to reverse
   lists.

   The arguments to 'splitOnHelper' are:

      splitOnHelper s group xs

      - 's     :: a'    the value to split on
      - 'group :: [a]'  the list of values in the current group, in reverse order
      - 'xs    :: [a]'  the input list of elements remaining to be processed. -}

{- 3 MARKS -}


{- 1.1.3 Removing Empties.

   The function 'splitOn' generates empty lists when there are
   consecutive occurrences of the splitting value. In some cases, we
   don't care about the empty lists. Write a function that takes a
   list of lists, and returns a list only containing the non-empty
   elements in the same order. Examples:

      removeEmpty [[1],[],[2]]         == [[1],[2]]
      removeEmpty [[],[]]              == []
      removeEmpty ["hello","","world"] == ["hello","world"] -}

removeEmpty :: [[a]] -> [[a]]
removeEmpty []       = []
removeEmpty ([]:xss) = removeEmpty xss
removeEmpty (xs:xss) = xs : removeEmpty xss

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.1.4 Splitting into words.

   Using 'splitOn' and 'removeEmpty', write a function that splits a
   string into words. Assume that words are separated by spaces ' '
   and that words are not empty. Examples:

      words "hello world"   == ["hello","world"]
      words "hello   world" == ["hello", "world"]
      words ""              == []
      words "   "           == []
      words "hello, world"  == ["hello,", "world"] -}

words :: String -> [String]
words str = removeEmpty (splitOn ' ' str)

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.1.5 Formatting paragraphs.

   In this problem, you will write a function for laying out
   monospaced paragraphs within a fixed margin width. We will
   represent paragraphs as lists of words:

       ["I","will","begin","the","story","of","my","adventures",
        "with","a","certain","morning","early","in","the","month",
        "of","June,","the","year","of","grace","1751,","when","I",
        "took","the","key","for","the","last","time","out","of",
        "the","door","of","my","father's","house."]

   (This is the first sentence of "Kidnapped" by Robert Louis Stevenson:
      https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kidnapped_(Stevenson)/Chapter_1 )

   The plan is to turn a list of words into a list of lines by adding
   words to a line with single spaces between them until adding one
   would go over the intended width. As a special case, we always put
   at least one word on each line, even if that would mean going over
   the limit. For example, if the width is 40, then we would get the
   following layout:

     [["I","will","begin","the","story","of","my","adventures"],
      ["with","a","certain","morning","early","in","the"],
      ["month","of","June,","the","year","of","grace","1751,"],
      ... ]

   In this example, the first line is length 39 after putting in the
   spaces. Adding 'with' would take us over the limit, so we start a
   new line.

   We will make the following simplifying assumptions:

     1. Each word takes up the same amount of space as it has
        characters (this is not true for all of the Unicode character
        set, and only really works for ASCII if we assume a monospaced
        font).

     2. Each space character ' ' takes up exactly one space.

   We encode these assumptions into the following function, which you
   will use to keep track of the current column words are being placed
   in. Given a current column 'col' and a word 'word', 'plusCol col
   word' returns the column we'll be in if we add a space and 'word'
   to the line: -}

plusWord :: Int -> String -> Int
plusWord col word = col + 1 + length word

{- Now you write the following function 'layOutLines'. The arguments are
   as follows:

     layOutLines w col line words

     - 'w :: Int' is the target width, use this to determine whether to start
       a new line or not.

     - 'col :: Int' is the current column we are in, it represents how
       wide 'line' is once spaces are added.

     - 'line :: [String]' is the list of words in the current line, in
       reverse order.

     - 'words :: [String]' is the list of words remaining to be added
       to some lines.

   The whole function ought to return the list of lines generated. See
   below for hints. -}

layOutLines :: Int -> Int -> [String] -> [String] -> [[String]]
layOutLines w col []   [] =
  []
layOutLines w col line [] =
  [reverse line]
layOutLines w col []   (word:words) =
  layOutLines w (length word) [word] words
layOutLines w col line (word:words) =
  if col `plusWord` word > w then
    reverse line : layOutLines w 0 [] (word:words)
  else
    layOutLines w (col `plusWord` word) (word:line) words

{- 5 MARKS -}

{- HINT: There are four cases of interest:

   1. We have no words remaining (words is []), and the line is empty.
   2. We have no words remaining, but there is something on this line.
   3. There are some words, but we are at the start of the line.
   4. There are some words, and we are in the middle of a line:
      4(a) the word fits on the line
      4(b) the word doesn't fit on the line

   Case three is important, because otherwise we never lay out a word
   that is longer than a line!

   HINT: the structure of the function is very similar to 'splitOn'
   above, except that the condition used to decide when to split into
   groups is slightly different. -}

{- Once you have written 'layOutParagraph', the following functions will
   start working, which call 'layOutParagraph' with the right initial
   values.

      'formatParagraph 80 kidnapped' should return:

    [["I","will","begin","the","story","of","my","adventures","with","a","certain","morning","early","in","the"],
     ["month","of","June,","the","year","of","grace","1751,","when","I","took","the","key","for","the","last","time","out"],
     ["of","the","door","of","my","father's","house."]]

   Some examples of 'printParagraph':

      *Ex1> printParagraph 80 kidnapped
      I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in the
      month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the last time out
      of the door of my father's house.

{- PART 2 : CURSORS                                                   -}
{----------------------------------------------------------------------}

{- In this part of the exercise, you will implement a simple line
   editor.

   The following datatype represents a 'pointer' into, or 'cursor' in,
   a list of characters. It allows us to edit the middle of the list
   without having to search all the way down from the head each
   time. In this section, we will build up to having a rudimentary
   line based text editor. -}

data Cursor
  = Within [Char] Char [Char]
  | AtEnd [Char]
  deriving Show

{- The 'Cursor' datatype has two constructors:

      'Within before point after'
        -- represents a cursor in the middle of the list
          - 'before' is the content of the list before the cursor, in reverse order
          - 'point'  is the item under the cursor
          - 'after'  is the content of the list after the cursor, in normal order

      'AtEnd before'
        -- represents a cursor just after the end of a list
          - 'before' is the content of the list before the cursor

   Examples (the '^' represents where the cursor is):

      Within "ba" 'c' "de"  represents   abcde
                                           ^

      Within "a" 'b' "cde"  represents   abcde
                                          ^

      Within "" 'a' "bcde"  represents   abcde
                                         ^

      AtEnd "edcba"         represents   abcde
                                              ^

   The function 'displayCursor' gives an ASCII art rendering of a
   cursor. Try it out in GHCi to see how it represents different
   cursor positions, and to get yourself familiar with the cursor
   representation. For example, try:

     *Ex1> displayCursor (Within "ba" 'c' "de")

   and the other example cursors above. -}

revAppend :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
revAppend []     ys = ys
revAppend (x:xs) ys = revAppend xs (x:ys)

displayCursor :: Cursor -> String
displayCursor (AtEnd before)              = revAppend before "[_]"
displayCursor (Within before point after) = revAppend before ('[':point:']':after)

{- 'toCursor' converts a list into a cursor, placing the cursor at the
   start of the list. Try it out in GHCi, along with the displayCursor
   function. -}

toCursor :: String -> Cursor
toCursor []     = AtEnd []
toCursor (x:xs) = Within [] x xs

{- 'fromCursor' forgets the position of the cursor in a list and returns
   the list. Again, try this function out in GHCi to familiarise
   yourself with the cursor representation. Try lots of different
   examples. -}

fromCursor :: Cursor -> String
fromCursor (AtEnd before)              = revAppend before []
fromCursor (Within before point after) = revAppend before (point:after)

{- 'getPoint' reads the item currently under the cursor. If the cursor
   is at the end of the line, it returns 'Nothing'. Otherwise, it
   returns 'Just point'. -}

getPoint :: Cursor -> Maybe Char
getPoint (AtEnd _)          = Nothing
getPoint (Within _ point _) = Just point


{- 1.2.0 Querying a cursor. Write two functions that (a) test whether or
   not a cursor is at the end of the line; and (b) test whether or not
   a cursor is at the start of the line. -}

atEnd :: Cursor -> Bool
atEnd (AtEnd _) = True
atEnd (Within _ _ _) = False

atStart :: Cursor -> Bool
atStart (AtEnd "")       = True
atStart (Within "" _ _ ) = True
atStart _                = False

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.2.1 Movement.

   Here is a function that moves the cursor one step to the
   right. There are three cases:

     1. If we are already at the end ('AtEnd'), we do nothing and
        return the cursor as is.

     2. If we are one before the end (the 'after' list is empty), the
        cursor becomes 'AtEnd', moving the point into the head of the
        'before' list.

     3. If the cursor is in the middle, we move the current point into
        the 'before' list, and take the head of the 'after' list as
        the new point.

   This definition illustrates why I chose to represent the 'before'
   list in reverse: it makes moving the cursor into a quick operation
   of prepending elements on to lists. -}

moveRight :: Cursor -> Cursor
moveRight (AtEnd before)                  = AtEnd before
moveRight (Within before point [])        = AtEnd (point:before)
moveRight (Within before point (a:after)) = Within (point:before) a after

{- Have a play with this function in GHCi to experiment with how it
   works.

   Now you write the 'moveLeft' function. There will be four cases:

    1. The cursor is at the end and start of an empty line
    2. The cursor is at the end of a non-empty line
    3. The cursor is at the start of a non-empty line
    4. The cursor is within a non-empty line.

   Turn these cases into Haskell patterns and work out what to do in
   each case.

   Some examples:

     moveLeft (AtEnd "")              == AtEnd ""
     moveLeft (AtEnd "olleh")         == Within "lleh" 'o' ""
     moveLeft (Within "" 'h' "ello")  == Within "" 'h' "ello"
     moveLeft (Within "eh" 'l' "lo")  == Within "h" 'e' "llo"

   A helpful thing to remember is that moveLeft (like moveRight)
   should not alter the content of the cursor in any way. More
   formally, for all cursors 'c', 'fromCursor c == fromCursor
   (moveLeft c)'. -}

moveLeft :: Cursor -> Cursor
moveLeft (AtEnd "")                      = AtEnd ""
moveLeft (AtEnd (b:before))              = Within before b ""
moveLeft (Within "" point after)         = Within "" point after
moveLeft (Within (b:before) point after) = Within before b (point:after)

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.2.2 Inserting Text.

   'moveRight' and 'moveLeft' do not alter the content of the
   cursor. Now you will write a function that does edit the
   text. 'insert x cur' should insert the value 'x' "before" the
   cursor (in a similar way to pressing a key inserts a character
   "before" the cursor in your text editor). Examples:

      insert 'x' (AtEnd "cba")         == AtEnd "xcba"
      insert 'x' (Within "ba" 'c' "d") == Within "xba" 'c' "d"
-}

insert :: Char -> Cursor -> Cursor
insert c (AtEnd before)              = AtEnd (c:before)
insert c (Within before point after) = Within (c:before) point after

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.2.3 Backspace.

   Write a function that edits the cursor in the same way as your
   backspace key does. That is, it removes the character to the left
   of the cursor. Remember to think carefully about the possible edge
   cases. You may want to experiment with the backspace key in your
   text editor. Be careful not to delete the rest of your answers!

       backspace (AtEnd "cba")          == AtEnd "ba"
       backspace (Within "cba" 'd' "e") == Within "ba" 'd' "e"
-}

backspace :: Cursor -> Cursor
backspace (AtEnd "")                      = AtEnd ""
backspace (AtEnd (b:before))              = AtEnd before
backspace (Within "" point after)         = Within "" point after
backspace (Within (b:before) point after) = Within before point after

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.2.4 Deletion.

   Write a function that deletes the element under the cursor (similar
   to pressing the 'delete' key in a text editor (not the backspace
   key!)). If there is no element under the cursor, then nothing
   happens. If there is any element to the right of the cursor, it is
   used to fill in the gap left. Examples:

     delete (AtEnd "cba")          == AtEnd "cba"
     delete (Within "cba" 'd' "")  == AtEnd "cba"
     delete (Within "cba" 'd' "e") == Within "cba" 'e' ""
-}

delete :: Cursor -> Cursor
delete (AtEnd before)              = AtEnd before
delete (Within before _ "")        = AtEnd before
delete (Within before _ (a:after)) = Within before a after

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.2.5 Overwrite

   Write another editing function that /replaces/ the element
   underneath the cursor with the given one, and does not move the
   cursor. If the cursor is at the end of the line, it should act as
   if the new character replaces the 'virtual' character at the end of
   the line. The cursor remains on the position of the overwritten
   character.

     overwrite 'X' (AtEnd "cba")           = Within "cba" 'X' ""
     overwrite 'X' (Within "cba" 'd' "ef") = Within "cba" 'X' "ef"
-}

overwrite :: Char -> Cursor -> Cursor
overwrite c (AtEnd before)          = Within before c ""
overwrite c (Within before _ after) = Within before c after

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.2.6 Multiple lines.

   The Cursor datatype represents a single line. We will now upgrade
   this to a multiline editor. The structure for implementing a
   multiline editor is very similar to the structure used for
   implementing the cursor.

   Here is the 'LineCursor' type: -}

data LineCursor
  = LineCursor [String] Cursor [String]
  deriving Show


{- A 'LineCursor' value has three parts:

       LineCursor above line below

   It consists of a list 'above' holding the lines above the cursor
   (in reverse), the cursor on the current line ('line'), and a list
   containing the lines below the current cursor. Notice the
   similarity to the 'Within' constructor in the 'Cursor'
   datatype. There is no analogue of the 'AtEnd' constructor because
   it is not possible to be off the end of the file.

   Implement the following functions.

   'currentLine' returns the 'Cursor' on the current line.

   'updateLine' replaces the 'line' cursor with a new one.

   'moveUp' simulates going up a line:
     - if the current line is the first one ('before' is empty), then
       the same LineCursor is returned.
     - otherwise, the current line is converted to a String (using
       'fromCursor' from the Ex1.hs file) and put into 'below', and
       the line above is converted to a cursor (using 'toCursor') and
       used as the new current line.

   'moveDown' is similar to 'moveUp' but simulates moving down a line. -}

currentLine :: LineCursor -> Cursor
currentLine (LineCursor _ line _) = line

updateLine :: LineCursor -> Cursor -> LineCursor
updateLine (LineCursor before _ after) line = LineCursor before line after

moveUp :: LineCursor -> LineCursor
moveUp (LineCursor [] point after)         = LineCursor [] point after
moveUp (LineCursor (b:before) point after) = LineCursor before (toCursor b) (fromCursor point:after)

moveDown :: LineCursor -> LineCursor
moveDown (LineCursor before point [])        = LineCursor before point []
moveDown (LineCursor before point (a:after)) = LineCursor (fromCursor point:before) (toCursor a) after

{- Once you have some or all of the functions above written, you will be
   able to use them as a simple text editor. Running

     λ> editor "Hello"

   typing them and pressing 'Enter'. The commands are:

{----------------------------------------------------------------------}

{- This part of the exercise asks you to write some functions for
   manipulating simple key/value stores, such as might be used to
   store configuration information for a service.

   The first three functions
   cover "flat" key/value stores, where keys are atomic and each key
   is associated to at most one value. The remaining questions in this
   section deal with "nested" or "heirarchical" key/value stores,
   where we have key value stores nested within one another (like
   folders in a file system). -}

{- 1.3.0 lookupKey

   We represent flat key/value stores as lists of pairs of keys and
   values, where all the keys are in sorted order and duplicate keys
   are not allowed. For instance, the list

     [("a",1), ("b",2)]

   represents a store where the key "a" has value 1, and the key "b"
   has value 2.

   (See the Week 02 videos and notes for examples of how to deal with
   sorted lists.)

   Write a function that looks up a key in a key/value store
   represented in this way. If the key is not there it should return
   'Nothing'.

   Examples:

      lookupKey "a" [("a",1),("b",2)] == Just 1
      lookupKey "b" [("a",1),("b",2)] == Just 2
      lookupKey "c" [("a",1),("b",2)] == Nothing
-}

lookupKey :: Ord k => k -> [(k,v)] -> Maybe v
lookupKey k [] = Nothing
lookupKey k ((k',v):kvs) | k == k'   = Just v
                         | otherwise = lookupKey k kvs

{- 1 MARK -}

{- 1.3.1 removeKey

   Write a function that removes a key from a key/value store. That
   is, it takes a key and key/value store as input, and returns a
   key/value store with that key missing. If the key is not there,
   then it ought to return the key/value store unchanged.

   Examples:

      removeKey "a" [("a",1),("b",2)] == [("b",2)]
      removeKey "b" [("a",1),("b",2)] == [("a",1)]
      removeKey "c" [("a",1),("b",2)] == [("a",1),("b",2)]

                          | otherwise = (k',v') : removeKey k kvs

{- 1 MARK -}

{- 1.3.2 insertKey

   Write a function that inserts a key/value pair into a key/value
   store. If the key is already present, then it should overwrite that
   key's value. If the key does not exist then it should add that
   key. Be sure to maintain the ordering of keys.

      insertKey "a" 3 [("a",1),("b",2)] == [("a",3),("b",2)]
      insertKey "b" 3 [("a",1),("b",2)] == [("a",1),("b",3)]
      insertKey "c" 3 [("a",1),("b",2)] == [("a",1),("b",2),("c",3)]
      insertKey "A" 3 [("a",1),("b",2)] == [("A",3),("a",1),("b",2)]

insertKey k v [] = [(k,v)]
insertKey k v ((k',v'):kvs)
  | k == k'   = (k,v):kvs
  | k < k'    = (k,v):(k',v'):kvs

{- We now look at hierarchical key/value stores. Instead of being a flat
   list of keys with associated values, we will allow keys to be
   associated with nested key/value stores as well as values. This
   will act similarly to how folders are nested on a file system.

   We represent nested key/value stores using the following datatype: -}

data Config
  = Value String
  | Store [(String, Config)]
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{- The constructor 'Value' represents a single value. So the 'Config'
   'Value "www.cis.strath.ac.uk"' is a configuration containing the
   single value "www.cis.strath.ac.uk".

   The constructor 'Store' represents a store containing a list of
   'String' keys with associated configurations. The pairs are
   expected to be in sorted order, with no duplicate keys (as
   above). For example, the 'Config's: -}

config1 :: Config
config1 = Store [("hostname",Value "www.cis.strath.ac.uk"),("port",Value "80")]

config2 :: Config
config2 = Store [("hostname",Value "www.strath.ac.uk"),("port",Value "8080")]

{- Represent two different stores with the same keys. The first
   associates "www.cis.strath.ac.uk" to "hostname", and "80" to
   "port". The second associates "www.cis.strath.ac.uk" and "8080".

   We can combine these into a single 'Config': -}

config3 :: Config
config3 = Store [("server1", config1),("server2", config2)]

{- If you evaluate 'config3' in GHCi, it will show you the full 'Config'
   value.

   Keys into a store are now lists of 'String's, so we make a type
   synonym to make our function types easier to read: -}

type Key = [String]



{- 1.3.3 emptyConfig

   Fill in the definition of 'emptyConfig' with a 'Config' that has no
   keys and no values. The wrong answer is 'Value ""', which has a
   single value. -}

emptyConfig :: Config
emptyConfig = Store []

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.3.4 set

   Fill in the definition of 'set'. This function should take a 'Key'
   and a 'String' and return the 'Config' that associates that key
   with that value.

   Examples:

      set [] "X"        == Value "X"
      set ["a"] "X"     == Store [("a",Value "X")]
      set ["a","b"] "X" == Store [("a",Store [("b",Value "X")])]
-}

set :: Key -> String -> Config
set []     c = Value c
set (k:ks) c = Store [(k,set ks c)]

{- 1 MARK -}


{- 1.3.5 getKey

   The function 'getKey' should return the nested configuration
   associated with the given 'Key'.

   Examples:

      getKey ["a","b"] emptyConfig         == Nothing
      getKey ["a","b"] (set ["a","b"] "X") == Just (Value "X")
      getKey ["server1"] config3           == Just (Store [("hostname",Value "www.cis.strath.ac.uk"),("port",Value "80")])
      getKey ["server3"] config3           == Nothing
      getKey ["server2","port"] config3    == Just (Value "8080")

   You will find it useful to use the 'lookupKey' function defined
   above. You will have to use a 'case' expression. -}

getKey :: Key -> Config -> Maybe Config
getKey []    c           = Just c
getKey (k:p) (Value _)   = Nothing
getKey (k:p) (Store kvs) =
  case lookupKey k kvs of
    Nothing -> Nothing
    Just c  -> getKey p c

{- 1.3.6 getValue

   The 'getKey' function returns the 'Config' associated with a key,
   but sometimes we'd like to just get any value associated with a key
   and raise an error when we get anything else.

   This datatype represents the possible outcomes of trying to find a
   key in a configuration: -}

data ValueResult
  = Ok String
  | KeyMissing
  | KeyNotAValue
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{- Implement 'getValue', which uses 'getKey' and returns 'Ok s' if the
   key is associated with 'Value s', 'KeyMissing' if the key is not
   found, and 'KeyNotAString' if the key is there, but isn't a value.

   Examples:

      getValue ["a"] (set ["a"] "x")     == Ok "x"
      getValue ["a"] emptyConfig         == KeyMissing
      getValue ["a"] (set ["a","b"] "x") == KeyNotAValue

getValue :: Key -> Config -> ValueResult
getValue key c =

    Nothing        -> KeyMissing
    Just (Value s) -> Ok s
    Just _         -> KeyNotAValue

{- 2 MARKS -}


{- 1.3.7 Merging configurations.

   Write a function that merges two configurations together into a
   single configuration. The rules are:

   - Every key in the output must exist in one of the two input
     configurations.

   - If a key appears in only one configuration, it has the same value
     in the output as it did in that configuration.

   - If a key appears in both configurations, we take the value from
     the *second* input configuration.

   Here are some examples:

     merge emptyConfig emptyConfig         == emptyConfig
     merge (set ["a"] "x") (set ["a"] "y") == set ["a"] "y"
     merge (set ["a"] "x") (set ["b"] "y") == merge (set ["a"] "x") (set ["b"] "y")
     merge config1 config2                 == config2

   You will have to write *two* functions that call each
   other. 'merge' merges two 'Config's together, so it needs to check
   for all combinations of 'Value' and 'Store' and do the right
   thing. When merging two 'Store's, it will need to call on
   'mergeKVs' which should merge two key/value stores, making sure to
   keep everything in order (see the mergesort example from Week
   02). When merging two identical keys, 'mergeKVs' will call 'merge'. -}

merge :: Config -> Config -> Config
merge _            (Value s)    = Value s
merge (Value _)    (Store kvs)  = Store kvs
merge (Store kvs1) (Store kvs2) = Store (mergeKVs kvs1 kvs2)

mergeKVs :: [(String,Config)] -> [(String,Config)] -> [(String,Config)]
mergeKVs [] kvs = kvs
mergeKVs kvs [] = kvs
mergeKVs ((k1,v1):kvs1) ((k2,v2):kvs2)
  | k1 == k2  = (k1, merge v1 v2) : mergeKVs kvs1 kvs2
  | k1 <  k2  = (k1, v1) : mergeKVs kvs1 ((k2,v2):kvs2)
  | otherwise = (k2, v2) : mergeKVs ((k1,v1):kvs1) kvs2

{- 1.3.8 Updating keys.

   Complete the following definition that updates a 'Config' by
   setting a key to a new value (with the effect of adding it if it
   doesn't already exist).

   how.  The "process" function takes a Process to interpret, and a
